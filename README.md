# Weather_Dashboard

With the Weather Dashboard application the user/traveler will select their desired destination.

The user/traveler will then be able to view an up to date 5 day forcast for the location. 

The user/traveler will be able to view attributes like UV index, wind, humidity and current temps. 

The data collected is being brought to us by OpenWeather One Call API at https://openweathermap.org/api/one-call-api 

This weather application will give the user/traveler the options to select from multiple cities that they may be interested in visiting. 




The user will be able to select from a city in the "recent search" history as well. 

The data entered in this application will also be stored into Local Storage on the system. 

Please see screenshot of deployed application in the assets/images folder.
